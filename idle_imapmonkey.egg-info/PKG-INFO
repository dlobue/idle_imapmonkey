Description: This module adds IDLE functionality into the standard Python library imaplib. The aim of this is to add a much sought-after feature while changing as little of the existing imaplib library as possible. The fact of the matter is that there are only two Python IMAP libraries that provide IDLE; one is not free nor open-source, and the other is riddled with bugs. The goal being to retain imaplib's battle-tested code base and be interchangable with imaplib.
